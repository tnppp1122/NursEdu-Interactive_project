# Nurse_project
> This is a project to improve the existing website of the Faculty of Nursing to make it fully functional as desired. This website is about create and take quizzes that simulate various scenarios, where each choice links to different questions.
* Developed with Flask, PostgreSQL.
* My job is to design the logic, functionality of the website and do all the backend.

# Result of project
* Because it is a website used only by the nursing faculty, I don't think it is appropriate to present the website.
* However, Can show how the website has evolved from the original.

# Things that are developed
## In original
> It is a website that allows you to create quizzes with a maximum of 3 questions, and each option can only connect to the next level question.
* Here is an example of the internal structure of a quiz that could be done.
